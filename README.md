# STUDENT_MANAGEMENT
A simple desktop-based CRUD application built using Java Swing for the GUI and JDBC for database connectivity. Users can add, update, delete, and view student records stored in a MySQL database. The project follows the DAO pattern to keep database logic separate from the UI, making the app clean and maintainable.
